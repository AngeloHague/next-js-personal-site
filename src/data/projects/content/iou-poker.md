For my Cross-Platform Development module at University, I developed this full-stack application using Expo, React Native, Colyseus.js and Firebase, achieving a first in the module. 

The concept is to allow friends to place hypothetical wagers on a Poker game, which are then stored using Firebase. Users can mark them as sent and received after the game is completed and a victor is decided.

I created a fully functional backend server using Colyseus.js to handle the Poker game itself, and stored data regarding the outcome of the game and wagers using Firebase. I made a frontend UI to interact with using React Native and Expo, though this was not too extravagent as the main focus of the assignment was the functionality of the application.
