Eager to expand upon my aforementioned projects in web development, I reached out to an old employer to ask to update their website. They used Shopify to sell their clothing online using a stock theme. The theme was old and lacked any optimisation, so I asked to update it to improve functionality and brand imagery. This project gave me the opportunity to work with a client and learn Shopify Liquid simultaneously.

I initially created this theme as a standard Shopify 1.0 theme, but then later upgraded it to Shopify 2.0 JSON Theme to make use of the advanced features (such as sorting and filtering projects) and the extensive metadata system. This allowed me to allow my client to add project banners to collections, alongside collection logos (as collections only typically have one image).
